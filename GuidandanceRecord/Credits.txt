WHEREAS:

1.4 “Intellectual Property Rights” means all rights in and to any copyright, trademark, trading name, design, patent, know how (trade secrets) and all other rights resulting from intellectual activity in the industrial, scientific, literary or artistic field and any application or right to apply for registration of any of these rights and any right to protect or enforce any of these rights, as further specified in clause 5.

4. LICENSEE’S OBLIGATIONS
4.1 The Licensee cannot use the Asset, for purposes other than as specified in this Agreement and in Item 8 of the Schedule.

PandaTip: The “purpose” (or “permitted use”) is a very important part of any license since it bounds the Licensee to specific use. Any other use will require separate negotiation of a separate license fee.

4.2 The Licensee may permit its employees to use the Asset for the purposes described in Item 8, provided that the Licensee takes all necessary steps and imposes the necessary conditions to ensure that all employees using the Asset do not commercialize or disclose the contents of it to any third person, or use it other than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

4.3 The Licensee will not distribute, sell, license or sub-license, let, trade or expose for sale the Asset to a third party.

4.4 No copies of the Asset are to be made other than as expressly approved by Licensor.

4.6 The Licensee will provide technological and security measures to ensure that the Asset which the Licensee is responsible for is physically and electronically secure from unauthorized use or access.

4.7 Licensee shall ensure that the Asset retains all Licensor copyright notices and other proprietary legends and all trademarks or service marks of Licensor.

5.1 All Intellectual Property Rights over and in respect of the Asset are owned by Licensor. The Licensee does not acquire any rights of ownership in the Asset.

6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
6.1 The Licensee acknowledges and agrees that neither Licensor nor its board members, officers, employees or agents, will be liable for any loss or damage arising out of or resulting from Licensor’s provision of the Asset under this Agreement, or any use of the Asset by the Licensee or its employees; and Licensee hereby releases Licensor to the fullest extent from any such liability, loss, damage or claim.

7. CONFIDENTIALITY
7.1 Neither Party may use, disclose or make available to any third party the other Party’s Confidential Information, unless such use or disclosure is done in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

7.2 Each Party must hold the other Party’s Confidential Information secure and in confidence, except to the extent that such Confidential Information:

8.2 The Asset is provided by Licensor on an “as is” basis.

PandaTip: By using the words “as is” you limit your liability for any claims the Licensee might make with respect to the Asset (that is, the item you are licensing). The point here is that the Licensee has seen the item in action, and that you are allowing them to use it, but are not making any guarantees.

8.3 Licensor will not be held liable by the Licensee in any way, for any loss, damage or injury suffered by the Licensee or by any other person related to any use of the Asset or any part thereof.

8.4 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, in no event shall Licensor be liable for any claims, damages or loss which may arise from the modification, combination, operation or use of the Asset with Licensee computer programs.

8.6 The Licensee acknowledges that:

a. The  Asset  has  not  been  prepared  to  meet  any specific  requirements  of  any party, including any requirements of Licensee; and
b. it is therefore the responsibility of the Licensee to ensure that the Asset meets its own individual requirements.

8.7 To the extent permitted by law, no express or implied warranty, term, condition or undertaking is given or assumed by Licensor, including any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

9. INDEMNITY
9.1 The Licensee must indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensor, its board members, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims (including third party claims), demands, actions, suits, expenses (including attorney’s fees) and damages (including indirect or consequential loss) resulting in any way from:

a. Licensee’s and Licensee’s employee’s use or reliance on the Asset,
b. any breach of the terms of this License Agreement by the Licensee or any Licensee employee, and
c. any other act of Licensee.

9.2 This clause 9 will survive termination of this Agreement.

10. WAIVER
